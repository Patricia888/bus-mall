##Marketing
As a maketing research team member, I want to discover user preferances for potential products so that Bus Mall can provide the items that garner the most interest. I will do this by analyzing the click data provided by the developer.

##Developer
As a developer, I want to display 3 images for the users to choose from and keep trck of all the click data (how many total clicks, how many times each image was displayed, how many times each image was clicked, and the percent click rate for each image) so that I can provide the marketing research team with meaningful data from the focus group study.

##Focus Group Participant
As a focus group participant, I want to choose which of the 3 displayed products interest me the most so that I can provide accurate data and make Bus Mall a better catalog with optimum products.
